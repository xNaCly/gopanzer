Help pages

    The help pages embedded into gopanzer are minimal and written in plain
    text. Gopanzer and its contents are well documented and can all be accessed
    using the 'help' build in:

        help [topic]

Syntax

    Headings are not indented. Text in a heading is indented using one tab.
    Commands to be executed using the panzer shell are indented one more tab
    than the surrounding text, such as:

        echo "command"

    Code, Commands and highlighted characters are written between '': such as
    the 'help' and 'alias' build ins.

    Optional arguments are notated via '[]', required arguments via '<>', see the panzer command:

        panzer [-c=<command>] [-v] [-d]
